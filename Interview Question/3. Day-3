Q1. What is the difference between pre-increment and post-increment operators in C++?
Pre-increment (++i): Increments the value of i before using it in the expression.
Post-increment (i++): Uses the current value of i in the expression and then increments it

Q2. What is a union in C++ and how is it different from a struct?
A union is a special data type that allows storing different data types in the same memory location. Only one member 
can hold a value at any given time. Unlike a struct, which allocates memory for all its members, a union allocates enough
memory to hold the largest member.

Q3. What is the difference between std::map and std::unordered_map?
std::map: Ordered collection of key-value pairs implemented as a balanced binary tree (usually a Red-Black tree). It provides
logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
std::unordered_map: Unordered collection of key-value pairs implemented as a hash table. It provides average constant time 
complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

Q4. What is the difference between struct and class in C++?
The primary difference is the default access level. In a struct, members are public by default, whereas in a class, 
members are private by default. Structs are typically used for passive data structures, while classes are used for more 
complex structures with encapsulation.

Q5. What is the use of static keyword in C++?
The static keyword can be used in various contexts:
Static variables in functions: Retain their value between function calls.
Static member variables: Shared among all instances of a class.
Static member functions: Can be called without an object and can only access static members of the class.
